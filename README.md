# ColmarAcademy
Codecademy -- In this capstone project, I will make typographic and color
design choices for a fictional school, Colmar Academy, and build their
responsive site from scratch.

Information for Code Reviewers:
1. The root of this project has a *public* folder and a *specs* folder. The
  *specs* folder contains design specifications provided by the customer. The
  *public* folder is the website code. If you wish to visualize the website
  in a browser you must add "/public" to the end of the GitHub-supplied URL.
2. As a developer I am keen to build things that are reusable. This explains
  why I took the approach of writing many CSS classes that decorate the HTML
  instead of writing just a few CSS classes that are application-specific.
3. One possible refinement is to break up *style.css* into two files: one
  file having application-specific code, and the other having
  application-independent code -- something that could be used in this
  project and others.
